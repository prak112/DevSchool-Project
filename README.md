# Background
The aim of the project is to build a functional E-commerce platform without a payment gateway. The tech stack I will be using are mentioned in [Tools](#tools). The project being a skills demonstration for Full-Stack Development will have  browsing functionality and a barter-exchange checkout.

The E-commmerce platform I have chosen to develop will be a Photo Store like ShutterStock, Pexels, FreePik, etc. Images advertised on the platform will be loaned. The website consists of :
- Images theme on the platform is *Nature*
- Art from *Bing Image Creator*
- Photos from *Pexels*
- Users or Customers can be Photographers, Artists or Enthusiasts.

<br>

A fully functional website allows the following functions to be performed :
- Authorize and authenticate Users(Customers) based on their credentials
- Customers can :
  - create their own profiles
  - Browse *Products* and add items to the *Cart*
  - Search *Products* through filters - *Category, Inventory, Artist Profile* 
  - Upload photographs and art to the *Product Inventory* as Payment
- *Real-Time Updates* updates inventory items based on the checked-out items
