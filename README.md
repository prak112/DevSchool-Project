# Project Setup
- Please refer to the [Guidebook](GUIDE.md) for steps to setup the development environment and execute the project.


# Background
The aim of the project is to build a functional E-commerce platform with a built-in payment gateway. For tech stack check [Tools](#tools). The platform being a skills demonstration for Full-Stack Development will have browsing functionality and a barter-exchange checkout.

**PG's Picsies** is a Photo store similar to ShutterStock, Pexels, FreePik, etc. Images advertised on the platform will be loaned (check [Credits](#credits)). The website consists of :
- Images themed on the platform is *Nature*
- Art from *Bing Copilot Designer*
- Photos from *Pexels*
- Users or Customers can be Photographers, Artists or Enthusiasts.

<br>

In brief, currently the application is capable of performing the following functions:
- Authorize and authenticate Users(Customers) based on their credentials
- Users/Customers can :
  - Register and create their own profiles
  - Browse *Products* and add items to the *Cart*
  - Search *Products* through filters - *Type, Theme & Author*
  - Edit their *Cart* - increase/decrease product quantity, remove product
  - Upload photographs and/or art to the *Product Inventory* as Payment

<br>

The application is fully-functional on a fundamental level (check [Walk-through](#walk-through))
<br>
The application will be updated at every chance available, for advanced functionality (check [Features in progress](#features-in-progress))

## Database Schema
- Database (SQLite) is implemented as an in-built version for Django
- Django Models are defined using the framework (`models.py`) for each of the apps defined (`users`, `photostore`)  to emulate tables similar to SQL
- After defining the required models the changes are updated through 'Migrations', which translate the instructions in `models.py` to the database to create/update tables
- Database schema (below) defines the logical flow of data through the application backend
